                    <h1>Overview</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The greenhouse effect is essential to life on Earth, but human-made emissions in the atmosphere are trapping and slowing heat loss to space.</li>
                        <li>Five key greenhouse gases are CO2, nitrous oxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor.</li>
                        <li>While the Sun has played a role in past climate changes, the evidence shows the current warming cannot be explained by the Sun.</li>
                        <li>Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the "greenhouse effect" — warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.</li>
                        <li>Life on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.</li>
                        <li>Four Major Gases That Contribute to the Greenhouse Effect:
                            <ul>
                                <li>FORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that forces a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

        <h2>Environmental Challenges and Our Objective</h2>
        <p>In response to the persistent environmental challenges posed by the widespread usage of carbon-emitting products in our modern, tech-driven society, this paper is guided by a central objective: contributing to the healing of our environment. Acknowledging the impracticality of expecting individuals to entirely abandon the use of cars, air conditioners, and similar contributors to carbon emissions, our approach aims to offer a practical remedy to address their environmental impact.</p>
        <p>Inspired by sources such as NASA, revealing a substantial increase in atmospheric CO2 levels since the 18th century, our team recognized the urgency of proactive measures. Current CO2 levels now stand at 150 percent of their 1750 values, surpassing the natural fluctuations observed at the conclusion of the last ice age 20,000 years ago. In light of these compelling statistics and an enhanced awareness of the depth of the environmental challenge, our team found inspiration to develop a solution focused on diminishing greenhouse gas emissions. Acknowledging the inevitability of continued product consumption contributing to carbon emissions, our strategy involves counterbalancing this impact by leveraging the carbon-absorbing properties of trees.</p>

    <div class="container section">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The widespread release of carbon emissions into the atmosphere stands as a significant contributor to environmental degradation, unleashing far-reaching consequences on the delicate equilibrium of Earth’s ecosystems. Driven by the realization that the environmental challenge extends beyond initial estimations, our team is motivated to explore tangible solutions. At the heart of our inquiry is a strategic approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Our proposed intervention focuses on addressing the environmental footprint of commonly used products by linking their purchase to a tree-planting initiative. This novel strategy capitalizes on the innate ability of trees to absorb and sequester carbon dioxide, presenting a symbiotic relationship between technology and environmental restoration.</p>
        <p>Yet, the practical implementation of such a vision is not without its challenges. During the ideation phase, a central question emerged: How do we encourage user engagement on our platform? What incentives can we provide to attract a wider user base? The answer lies in a rewards-based system, where users are motivated to register and actively participate in environmental conservation efforts by earning redeemable points.</p>

        <h2>Carbon Emission Sources</h2>
        <p>In today’s era there are various sources which contribute in emission of gases that lead to greenhouse effect and eventually climate changes. Most of the major sectors include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Electricity and Heat Production</li>
            <li>Industries</li>
            <li>Buildings with large gatherings</li>
            <li>Fashion industries</li>
            <li>Automobiles</li>
            <li>Increase in use of Air-Conditioners</li>
            <li>Various types of plastic paints being used in Houses and various office buildings</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="container section">
        <h2>Carbon Footprints</h2>
        <p>The imprint left by human-induced greenhouse gas emissions is commonly referred to as the carbon footprint. This metric serves as an environmental gauge, encompassing the quantification of both direct and indirect releases of various compounds. Among these are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Methane (CH4)</li>
            <li>Nitrous oxide (N2O)</li>
            <li>Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)</li>
            <li>Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)</li>
            <li>Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)</li>
            <li>Carbon dioxide (CO2) – the preeminent contributor to global warming since 1990</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This collective measurement provides insights into the comprehensive impact of human activities on the atmospheric composition and climate.</p>

    <div class="container section">
        <h2>Societal Trends and Carbon Emissions: The Fashion Connection</h2>
        <p>The creation of a simple cotton shirt entails the consumption of vast quantities of water, posing not only a threat to the Earth but also endangering the well-being of its inhabitants. The volatile nature of fashion trends makes it challenging for even major brands to keep pace. Notably, the fashion industry stands out as a major contributor to carbon emissions. Regrettably, the younger generation remains largely unaware that their wardrobes are filled with clothing items that actively contribute to the degradation of their planet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container section">
        <h2>Green Equilibrium: Afforestation Countering Carbon Emission</h2>
        <p>Afforestation, which involves the planting of trees on land that was previously not forested, can contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions through various mechanisms. Some of them are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Carbon Sequestration</li>
            <li>Biomass Storage</li>
            <li>Reduced Deforestation</li>
            <li>Oxygen Production</li>
            <li>Climate Regulation</li>
            <li>Promotion of Sustainable Practices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It’s important to note that while afforestation is beneficial for carbon sequestration, it is just one part of a comprehensive strategy to address climate change. Combining afforestation with efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions, promote renewable energy, and adopt sustainable practices is essential for effective climate action.</p>
